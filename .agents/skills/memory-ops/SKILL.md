# Memory Skill Operations (記憶技能操作指引)

## 1. Core Mandate (支配規則)

All memory card **writes and updates** MUST follow the **two-step flow**:

1. Use native tools (`write_to_file` / `replace_file_content`) to write the full SKILL.md content
2. Call `cartridge-system__memory_commit` to sync metadata (timezone, staleness, index)

**Commit Obligation (歸卡義務)**: Skipping step 2 is FORBIDDEN. A memory card written without `memory_commit` is considered INCOMPLETE. The Completion Gate will reject the workflow.

> **Legacy**: `memory_update(mode: replace)` is still available as a fallback but NOT recommended.
> **Deprecated**: `memory_update(mode: patch)` and `memory_update(mode: append)` are deprecated due to high error rates in Markdown merging.

> **Exception**: During audit workflows (`/08_audit`), **reading and verification** via `view_file` is permitted to validate memory card contents.

> **Timestamp Standard**: ALL timestamps MUST use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+08:00`. UTC (`Z` suffix) is FORBIDDEN.

## 2. Reading Memory (載入記憶)

```
Need to load memory?
├── Full project overview or handoff (/11_handoff)
│   └── Call memory_list → returns all module names + health status
└── Single module context (pre-task loading)
    └── Call memory_read(moduleName) → returns full SKILL.md content
```

> **Ghost Awareness (v4.0)**: `memory_list` now returns a `ghostFilesCount` field per module.
> If `ghostFilesCount > 0`, tracked files have been deleted from disk but remain registered in the cartridge.
> Prioritize these modules — after reading the card, remove deleted paths from `## Tracked Files`,
> then call `memory_commit` to synchronize.

## 3. Repairing Stale Memory (過期修復)

When a memory cartridge has staleness > 0, you **MUST NOT** simply call `memory_update` to reset staleness. Follow this repair procedure:

### Staleness Repair Procedure (過期修復流程)

```
Stale memory card detected?
├── Step 1: Call memory_status(moduleName) ← diagnose staleness
│   ⇒ Returns: staleness index, changed files list (absolute paths), action guidance
├── Step 2: Call view_file on each changed file
│   ⇒ Understand the latest state of the source code
├── Step 3: Call memory_read(moduleName)
│   ⇒ Read existing memory content
├── Step 4: Compare source code changes vs existing memory
│   ⇒ Produce updated memory content (update decisions/known issues/lessons sections)
├── Step 4.5: Check ghostFiles (v4.0)
│   ⇒ Call memory_status; if ghostFiles array is non-empty
│   ⇒ Confirm these files have been removed from the project
│   ⇒ Remove corresponding paths from the ## Tracked Files section
│   ⇒ If ALL tracked files in the module are ghosts, consider retiring the entire memory card
├── Step 5: Use write_to_file to write the updated SKILL.md
│   ⇒ Full content including updated sections
└── Step 6: Call memory_commit(moduleName, projectRoot)
    ⇒ staleness auto-resets to 0 + pendingChanges auto-cleared + index synced
```

> **FORBIDDEN**: Calling `memory_commit` without first completing Steps 1–5 to sync content. Staleness reset is a SIDE EFFECT of sync, not the goal.

## 4. Updating Memory (更新記憶)

After modifying source files tracked by a memory skill, you **MUST** update the corresponding memory card.

### Mandatory Flow (強制流程 — 不可略過)

> **Indirect Staleness Awareness (v4.0)**: `memory_list` now returns an `indirectStaleness` field per module.
> If `indirectStaleness > 0`, an upstream dependency cartridge has gone stale.
> Call `memory_deps(moduleName)` to inspect upstream cartridges and confirm whether upstream changes
> affect this module's Key Decisions or Known Issues before deciding to update.

```
Need to update memory?
├── 🔍 Granularity pre-check: does the target memory card have > 8 trackedFiles?
│   └── Yes → Pause update. Execute memory-arch split procedure first.
├── Step 1: Call memory_read(moduleName) to get current content
│   ⇒ Understand existing decisions, tracked files, known issues
├── Step 2: Use write_to_file / replace_file_content to write updated SKILL.md
│   ⇒ Include all sections: frontmatter, Tracked Files, Key Decisions, etc.
│   ⇒ AI native tools provide the highest write stability
└── Step 3: Call memory_commit(moduleName, projectRoot)
    ⇒ Auto-injects Taiwan timezone timestamp
    ⇒ Auto-resets staleness to 0
    ⇒ Auto-syncs cartridge_index.json (clears pendingChanges, re-parses trackedFiles)
    ⇒ Returns structural validation report
```

### Legacy Fallback (舊版備用)

- `memory_update(mode: replace)`: Send complete SKILL.md content for full replacement. Still functional but less stable than the two-step flow.
- `memory_update(mode: patch)`: **Deprecated** — High error rate due to Markdown section matching sensitivity.
- `memory_update(mode: append)`: **Deprecated** — No structural validation, causes duplicate sections.

### Post-Commit Obligations (歸卡後義務)

1. Under `## Module Lessons`, append reusable knowledge discovered (format: `Dxx: description`)

### Enforcement (強制閘門)

The following enforcement mechanisms ensure compliance:

1. **Completion Gate** — BLOCKS workflow completion if modified files are not reflected in memory cards
2. **Commit Staleness Warning** — `/09_commit_log` HALTS before committing if memory is stale

## 4.5 New File Attribution (新建檔案歸屬義務)

When your workflow creates new source code files, you MUST attribute them to memory cards BEFORE entering the Completion Gate.

```
New source file created?
├── Step 1: Call memory_list to get all cards with scopePath
├── Step 2: Match new file path against scopePath prefixes
│   ├── Match found → Add file to that card's ## Tracked Files + memory_commit
│   └── No match → Step 3
└── Step 3: HALT and propose to Director:
    ├── Option A: Expand nearest card's scopePath to cover the new file
    └── Option B: Create new memory card (load memory-arch skill)
```

**FORBIDDEN**: Leaving new source files untracked. Every production source file MUST belong to exactly one memory card.

## 4.6 Lazy Upgrade Protocol (舊版記憶卡延遲升級義務)

When modifying, fixing logic, or repairing staleness on a legacy memory card (e.g. ones created before V5 architecture), you MUST organically upgrade the card format during your two-step flow to match the latest structural requirements:
- Inject missing fields strictly according to the format constraint.
- Normalize section headers (e.g., ensure `## Tracked Files` matches naming conventions).
- **Goal**: Seamlessly patch technical debt dynamically on-demand. Avoid massive migration shocks.

<!-- NOTE: Creation, Tree Topology, and Splitting operations have been migrated to the memory-arch skill. -->

## 5. System Memory (系統記憶)

- Path: `.agents/memory/_system/SKILL.md`
- Content: tech stack, host platform, deployment config
- Update rules: same as § 4 (write → commit)
